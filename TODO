Current issues
---
 * You should be able to do basic grab/list/delete without a token (with 2 hour lifetime only)
 * We should be able to tell when a failure is token based vs other params
 * We should basically have three levels of permissions:
    - unauthenticated you get CRD on VMs but no update and low default lifetime
    - VMPOOL_TOKEN set - you get CRUD on VMs but can't manipulate tokens
    - LDAP_PASSWORD and LDAP_USERNAME set -- full access

 Version 2
 ---
 * Add godoc to functions
 * Add timeframe option to summary
 * Add reap feature to read log and delete all vms
 * Snapshot subcommand

 Roadmap
 ---
 * Try this out on Windows
 * Auto ssh into vm after grabbing
 * User-specified tags?
